"""The outgoing-payments list, and the promises it makes about money.

The list used to be a stored script inside a Custom HTML Block on one site:
19 KB of JavaScript in a database row, with no review, no history and no test
around it -- on the page that sends money. It lives in this app now, and the
properties that matter are asserted rather than hoped for.

Four of them, and each has a way it goes wrong:

  * a batch button offers more than it will do -- somebody selects thirty
    orders, presses Approve, and only nine were drafts, so twenty-one silently
    did nothing;
  * a batch reports only its successes, and half a selection goes missing;
  * a send picks one paying account out of several, debiting the wrong one;
  * approving is presented as sending, so a click that was meant to lock an
    order in fact moves money.
