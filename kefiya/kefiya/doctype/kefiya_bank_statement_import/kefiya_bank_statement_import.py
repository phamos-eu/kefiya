"""Import a statement file.

This document is a form and a status; the reading lives in
statement_formats.py and the booking in statement_import.py.

It used to hold both, twice: two near-identical methods that differed only in
the file's encoding, each with its own amount parser -- one of which divided
by a hundred whenever an amount carried no decimal separator. The encoding is
now handled once, the layout that needed them is declared as a profile, and
those 250 lines are gone with the bug in them.
