// Entering an outgoing transfer, laid out the way a transfer form is.
//
// The dialog this replaces asked for account, recipient, IBAN, amount, purpose
// and a bare date field -- and that was all. The document has carried three
// more decisions the whole time and none of them could be made here:
//
//   execution_date    when it should happen
//   manage_due_date   who holds it until then, we or the bank
//   instant_payment   whether it goes as a SEPA instant payment
//
// A date field alone cannot say "as soon as possible" versus "on the 24th",
// and it certainly cannot say who keeps the order in the meantime. So the
// execution is asked as what it is: a choice, then its details.
//
// The recipient is a free field. It suggests known payees, but it does not
// require one -- the whole point of this document is a transfer that has no
// invoice behind it. The IBAN carries the safeguard instead: the document
// checks its checksum before anything is stored.
