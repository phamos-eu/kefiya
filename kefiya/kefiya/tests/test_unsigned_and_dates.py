"""Two ways an order was reported as sent without ever reaching the bank.

Both were found on the same transfer. 58,80 EUR went out, no TAN was asked
for, nothing was debited, and the outbox said "Sent" -- for the second time in
this project, with a guard already written against exactly that.

The guard could not work. required_signatures() reads the number the bank
states per account, and stored_rows() never selected the column: the row came
back with the field unset, cint(None) turned it into 0, and 0 reads as "no
signature required". That is the one reading that turns a missing TAN into a
successful payment, and it applied to every account on the instance -- 49
stored transfer capabilities there demand a signature.

The second is why no TAN was asked for in the first place. The message carried
ReqdExctnDt = 16.08.2026 on the 25th, because build_pain001_for() sent
doc.execution_date whatever it meant. For an order the bank holds, the date IS
the order. For one WE hold, the date is our bookkeeping: the order sits in the
outbox and, on the day it is sent, is an ordinary immediate transfer. Sending
it as a requested execution date puts a past day into the message.

Read from source: frappe is not installed where these run, and what has to be
true is about the code.
