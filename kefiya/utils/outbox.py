"""The outgoing-payments page, as data.

The outbox is where an order stands between "entered" and "at the bank". Three
states, and they are not the same thing:

    draft (docstatus 0)        entered, not approved yet -- still changeable
    approved (docstatus 1)     amounts and recipients are fixed
    held back (on_hold)        approved, but deliberately not going out

This used to be a Server Script stored on one site, and two things about that
were wrong rather than merely inconvenient.

The first is the reason it is being read here now: it wrote the reasons an
order is not going out as German literals -- "Zurueckgestellt", "Faellig erst
am", "Empfaengerpruefung offen". Umlauts do not survive being typed into a
script editor by whoever is nearest, and there is nothing in a stored script
that notices. Here they are English source strings, translated in
translations/de.csv, where a test reads every one of them.

The second is that a page's data source living outside the app means the page
works on that site and nowhere else, and nothing in the app's tests can see
the dependency. The same reason payee_check.known_payees() exists.

Two things also got better on the way in, both because a Server Script cannot
do them: permissions are asked with frappe.has_permission instead of reading
DocPerm rows by hand, and which accounts may pay is asked of
account_kind.transfer_sources() instead of being reimplemented.

    Nobody attaches the travel expense PDF to the transfer. It is created on

    BT-0001" in its purpose. So the purpose is read, and the attachments of
    what it names are counted too -- a receipt that cannot be found from the
    payment is a receipt that gets asked for twice.

    Two things this has to get right, and both are about the count agreeing
    with the dialog it points at.

    The names come out of free text, so a File is only counted when the caller
    may actually read the document it hangs on. Otherwise the column says
    "3 receipts" and the dialog -- which reads the same files through
    frappe.client.get_list, and therefore through File's permissions -- opens
    empty, and the reader is left to wonder which of the two is lying.

    And the doctype is checked, not just the name. "BT-0001" is a name, not an
    address: a File hanging on some other doctype whose document happens to be
    called that is not a receipt for this payment.

    One query for the whole page, plus one permission question per distinct
    document. Asking per row would be a request per order to show one number.
